            <h2>Aspect Descriptions</h2>
            <h3>Intellect</h3><p>High scorers have an hunger for knowledge, enjoy mentally stimulating activities, and feel at home with abstract ideas. Low scorers are typically more physical than intellectual and prefer simple interests or tasks over complex ones.</p>
            <h3>Openness</h3><p>High openness means you prioritize imagination, introspection, new experiences, and you are open-minded to alternative and unconventional approaches. A low score means you are more conventional, conservative, and down-to-earth.</p>
            <h3>Industriousness</h3><p>People high in this trait are ambitious, goal-oriented, and they will work hard and smart to get things done as efficiently as possible. Low scorers tend to procrastinate and waste time more, and they may prioritize play over work.</p>
            <h3>Orderliness</h3><p>Highly orderly people make plans and organize their environment. They are careful about making decisions, and they may be perfectionistic. Low scorers tend to be more messy and spontaneous. They may have a harder time planning but they can be more adaptable.</p>
            <h3>Enthusiasm</h3><p>High scorers are enthusiastic, and can be considered the life of the party. They enjoy socializing and have a more cheerful disposition. Low enthusiasm means you are more serious and reserved, and maybe not as interested in socializing.</p>
            <h3>Assertiveness</h3><p>People who are highly assertive take charge and lead other people. They can be considered as dominant and persuasive. Low scorers are more likely to take passive roles or work behind-the-scenes. They prefer responding rather than initiating.</p>
            <h3>Compassion</h3><p>High compassion means you favor mercy and have a soft heart in general. They are easily affected by others' feelings, and want to help others in many ways. Low score means you are not as sensitive and you tend to prefer justice and rational approaches over mercy.</p>
            <h3>Politeness</h3><p>High scorers dislike conflict and they prefer cooperation over competition. They are humble and dislike bragging too much. Low scorers are not as polite and they may be more competitive, manipulative, arrogant, or willing to fight for what they want.</p>
            <h3>Withdrawal</h3><p>High scorers are familiar with feelings of doubt, worry, and sadness. They can get caught up in problems or feel embarrased or discouraged easily. Low scorers are not as prone to feeling anxious, depressed, or insecure. They tend to feel more confident.</p>
            <h3>Volatility</h3><p>Being high in volatility means your emotions are easily affected and volatile. You may feel angry when things are going wrong, have explosive moods, or overindulge in things. Low volatility means emotionally stable, calm, and controlled in reaction.</p>
